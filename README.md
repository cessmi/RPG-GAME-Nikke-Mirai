# 🎮 RPG Game: Lament of the Departed

Welcome to **Lament of the Departed** — **Part 1** of a fully original RPG created entirely from scratch in **Java**.  
No engines. No templates. Just pure code, art, and heart.

> 🎨 All assets — from characters to environments to UI — were handcrafted by us.  
> 🧠 All logic — game loop, rendering, collisions, dialogues — was built from the ground up.

## ✨ About the Game

**Lament of the Departed** follows the mysterious journey of a lone character navigating a broken world filled with haunting echoes of the past. Through pixel-crafted maps and emotionally-driven dialogues, players uncover a tale of loss, memory, and choice.

This is **Part 1** of a two-part narrative.  
**Part 2** will be continued by **Zoie Estorba**.
